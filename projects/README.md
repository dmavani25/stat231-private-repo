# PEER GROUPS

In collaboration with your Peer Group, you will embark on a data science project for the remainder of the semester, with the overarching goals of advancing your data science skills and experiencing how empowering data science can be. 

Through the project, I hope  you gain confidence in your coding skills, hone your critical-reasoning abilities, and build perseverance. I also hope you recognize the role of data science in tackling important issues, and that the projects provide an important, meaningful lens in understanding the world.

The project will be divided into two parts: a mid-semester **Shiny App** and an end-of-semester **Blog**. Each part is deliberately open-ended (with a few rules each) to allow you to explore your creativity and interests.

### Learning Objectives

The learning objectives of the Peer Group Project are to demonstrate your ability to:

1. identify a set of questions that can be addressed with data available to you;

2. wrangle a large, messy dataset (including gathering, reshaping, and cleaning the data) into a format necessary to answer the question(s) at hand;

3. deploy interactive data visualizations using Shiny;

4. effectively communicate results via visualizations and oral presentation;

5. effectively collaborate with your peers and identify the value in teamwork; and

6. demonstrate awareness of ethical considerations related to data acquisition, management, and communication.

### Next steps due by 10pm ET Monday, September 20

Browse the list below to find your peer group. 

This week/weekend, you should connect with your peer group. I have created a private Campuswire group chat for you as a first step (I cannot see any of your messages unless you invite me back into the group), but I imagine many of you will exchange numbers for easier contact. (Also, did you know there is a mobile app for Campuswire for [iOS/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/campuswire/id1222147987) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.campuswire.android&hl=en_US)? It was pretty glitchy last I checked but still got the job done in terms of quickly checking things on Campuswire---I would not recommend for posting/answering questions in the Class Feed, though.)

Start brainstorming topics or questions are you interested in exploring related to your Peer Group theme. I encourage you to each make your own list without discussing it with each other, then share your lists simultaneously at an agreed upon time. Dream big here! Don't worry yet about whether there is data out there that's available and accessible that you could use to address your questions/topics.  Just brainstorm some ideas that get you excited. Also choose a team name! (The team name can be edited later if creativity escapes you initially.) 


When you have agreed on an initial set of ideas/questions, elect one person to set up a repo for your shiny app (e.g., "stat231-team-name-shiny") and add your peers as collaborators. Then submit an issue titled **Project ideas** structured as follows:

```
## Section [01/02], Peer Group Number [1/.../8]
Peer group members


## Ideas
Describe your questions/ideas!!

```

You may edit this issue as your ideas develop/change as well. My only request would be that if I leave a comment and you make modifications based on that, please add a new comment below it instead of editing the initial comment in the issue (I'll get notifications for the initial comment and any new comments but not for any edits to comments).
